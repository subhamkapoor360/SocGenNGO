# SocGenNGO

It is an Android App which aims for the social good.It was made in a hackathon organized by Societe Generale. Basically we see a lot of unattened problems around us.
So using this app we can post the problems we face in our society along with a geotagged photo of the problem. This problem is then forwaded to the NGO's. One of the NGO takes the initiative of the problem and if they fulfill it within the alloted time they will be given incentives like funding for cottage or small scale industry
